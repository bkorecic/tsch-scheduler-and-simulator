# Description

Fork of the original collection of scheduling algorithms by [pedrohenriquegomes](https://github.com/pedrohenriquegomes/tsch-scheduler-and-simulator). The purpose of this fork is to isolate the necessary code for running the TASA algorithm in a MAX78000 microcontroller.

# Build/Flash

Follow the documentation in the [MSDK user guide](https://analogdevicesinc.github.io/msdk/USERGUIDE/#installation) to install the SDK.

Run `make` to build or `make flash.openocd` to build and flash the microcontroller.
